## Introduction

[Workshop Webpage](https://www.eva.mpg.de/comparative-cultural-psychology/events/2024-btg2/´)

Technological breakthroughs create immense opportunities to revolutionize scientific methodologies and enable answers to questions that were previously unanswerable. Disciplines studying behavior and cognition across species are struggling to keep up with the rapid technological developments. In 2022, we organized a workshop to help bridge this technological gap. Through the workshop we (a) trained 31 early career researchers in the use of cutting-edge non-invasive technologies including motion-tracking, eye-tracking, thermal imagining, and machine learning extensions, (b) developed guidelines and common standards in the use of these methods, and (c) created an online platform with a diverse network of researchers, and (d) initiated an interdisciplinary collaboration project with most of the workshop participants involved using thermal imaging with many different species. Building on the success of the 2022 event, we plan to organize this workshop again. Our goal is to continue providing opportunities for early career researchers to gain expertise in innovative technologies, build connections between interdisciplinary and international scholars, and foster the exchange of ideas and future collaborations.
