# “Let’s Git” - Intro to Git and GitHub
Monday, August 5, 2024, 11:30 – 12:30 by Bret Beheim

# Downloading the example repository

In this course we will work on an example repository together using git version control. The materials are located on the [BTG2024 Nextcloud](https://share.eva.mpg.de/index.php/s/gRRHDB6jGSHTytd) in the Lets-Git folder. Please download `workflow-example.zip` and unzip it locally.

# Installing git locally

Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public version of your code on websites like github.com.

Having git installed locally on your machine is necessary to follow along during the workshop. Installation instructions for MacOS, Windows or Linux can be found here: https://hbec-mpi-eva.github.io/2023-11-27-leipzig/

You can confirm that you have git installed by typing `git -v` into the terminal or the Bash shell and getting an informative message, e.g. `git version 2.39.3 (Apple Git-146)`.

# Using Github

We will do a few hands-on exercises on Github itself. If you don't have a Github account, you can set one up for at https://github.com/. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already. Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For example, you may want to review [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/) for keeping your email address private provided at GitHub.
