# Bio-TIP: Bio-Signal Retrieval from Thermal Imaging Processing
Thursday, August 8, 2024, 15:30 â€“ 17:00 by Pierre-Etienne Martin

## Introduction
Thermal images allows us to capture thermale temperature over time, thus, changes in temperatures. When applied with living creatures, these changes can be correlated with physiologicals signals. In this hands-on session. we are going to process the recording of a thermal camera and analyze the temperature variation over time.

## Data
During the Workshop, you will have the oppotunirty to acquire your own data. For this purpose, you will first have to sign a [Consent Form](data/Consent_form.pdf) for the acquisition with stimulus and the re-distribtuion of the data.

Because each recording is very heavy (~1Gb for 30s recording), download only your own recording or the example recording in the folder `data`.

All data is available on this [time limited password protected repository](https://share.eva.mpg.de/index.php/s/gRRHDB6jGSHTytd) (password will be shared during the workshop and the repository will no-longer be accessible after the workshop).

If you do not wish to have your own data recorded, you are free to use the [1-example.zip](https://share.eva.mpg.de/index.php/s/J6mDkiGii4fKCaT) file.
